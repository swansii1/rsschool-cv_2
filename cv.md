### About me
Hello everyone, my name is Matvey. I have been working for a long time where I don't like to work, namely in the restaurant business. I also had modest attempts in business, I had my own team of handymen, and also, studying to be a programmer, I was engaged in the sale of nicotine. Yes, I studied in the direction of "Information systems and programming", but this cannot be called a study because it was not interesting to me and I came there to smoke near the entrance. I've been studying development for only 1 month, I like it, let's see what happens next...
